# Nathaniel Getachew(Draft)

I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a particular interest in fake news classification.

## Education
- **PhD in Computer Science** (Ongoing)
  - Purdue University
- **B.A in Comptuter Science**, Mathematics
  - Pomona College, class of 2023

## Research Interests
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Fake News Classification
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning

## Current Projects
### Fake News Classification
I am currently working on leveraging Large Language Models to help with fake news detection. Specifically, I'd like to use the internet to inform predictions. Large Language Models have great internal knowledge and are good for synthesizing internet results that contain a lot of information, but they still have their pitfalls. I will soon be adding blog posts to this website to document my progress
