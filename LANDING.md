# Nathaniel Getachew(Draft)

## About Me
I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University. My research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a particular interest in fake news classification.

## Education
- **PhD in Computer Science** (Ongoing)
  - Purdue University

## Research Interests
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Fake News Classification

## Current Projects
### Fake News Classification
I am currently working on developing advanced algorithms for detecting fake news. My approach involves using state-of-the-art NLP techniques to analyze text and identify patterns indicative of misinformation.

#### Objectives:
- Improve the accuracy of fake news detection.
- Develop models that can generalize across different domains and languages.
- Explore the ethical implications of automated fake news detection.

### Sentiment Analysis in Social Media
I am also interested in understanding the sentiment expressed in social media posts and how it correlates with the spread of fake news. This project aims to:
- Analyze the sentiment in large datasets of social media posts.
- Investigate the relationship between sentiment and the propagation of fake news.
