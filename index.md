I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University advised by [Dr. Abulhair Saparov](https://asaparov.org/) . I'm interested in projects broadly related to the world modeling abilities of LLMs. This is something you typically see studied in game-like environments, but I'd like to see what happens when you shift this paradigm to other domains. I intend to explore this in social reasoning and document understanding problems. Read more about my thoughts for future research [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tK-3hWZ2lWw1V8QhgLj3hCDctYWcn2isyNlBGyvdRg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.rs0shqmwd2am).

## Hobbies and Interests

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy running and playing guitar. I ran for the Pomona Pitzer and Purdue Track & Cross Country Teams. Chirp Chirp, and Boiler Up!
