I'm a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at Purdue University. I'm interested in projects broadly related to the world modeling abilities of LLMs. This is something you typically see studied in game-like environments, but I'd like to see what happens when you shift this paradigm to other domains. I intend to explore this in social reasoning and document understanding problems. Read more about my thoughts for future research [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15tK-3hWZ2lWw1V8QhgLj3hCDctYWcn2isyNlBGyvdRg/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.rs0shqmwd2am).
